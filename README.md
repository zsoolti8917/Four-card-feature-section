## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

For this roject i choosed the mobile first flow which i really like. I enjoyed this project altougether had some problems with the positioning of the cards on bigger screen sizes, i solved the positioning with grid which i think is a good aproach.

### Continued development

I do not plan to improve this project i think i did a pretty good job reflecting my knowledge, i am sure there are better ways to solve this but i am happy with it. Maybe in the future when i learn REACT and SCSS i will redo the project from scratch adding some animations etc.
